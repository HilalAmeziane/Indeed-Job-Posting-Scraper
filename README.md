Description
This project is a robust automation solution for scraping job postings from Indeed, developed using modern tools like Puppeteer and Node.js. It is designed to extract key information such as job titles, locations, and other relevant details directly from job listing pages. This project serves as a strong foundation for use cases such as:

Collecting data for job market trend analysis.
Automating job opportunity monitoring.
Integrating job listing data into HR systems or job search platforms.
The solution is built with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy adaptation to other platforms or additional features.

Key Features
Robust scraping capabilities: Leverages Puppeteer to simulate a browser and dynamically capture data from Indeed pages.
Targeted data extraction: Retrieves job titles, locations, and other details using precise CSS selectors and logic to handle HTML structure variations.
Captcha handling: Basic detection and handling of captchas to minimize interruptions during scraping.
Customizability: Easily extendable to include other platforms or features such as content analysis.
Data storage: Exported scraped data is saved in JSON format for further processing.
Technologies Used
This project is powered by a modern and efficient technology stack:

Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
Puppeteer: A powerful library for web scraping and browser automation.
CSV-Parse: Handles parsing of CSV files to manage URL lists.
JavaScript/TypeScript: Primary languages for writing scraping logic and managing data.
